1. @BeforeClass:

Every new class that is made will invoke the app, so you will
be starting from the homepage with app data cleared. This is good
for tests, like functional tests, that require fresh data.

If you do multiple of '@Test' in the same class then the app will
continue from the point where the previous test ended.

By using '@BeforeMethod' you can write code that runs before every test
Example:

@BeforeMethod
public void preSetup(){
    //set screen
    Activity activity = new Activity(*package-name*, *activity-name*);
    /*
    To find these, go to the required screen in the emulator then go to
    terminal and type:
    adb shell dumpsys window | findstr mCurrentFocus
    */
}

2. Running Test Cases Together

Sequentially:
Make a xml file and structure in the way testing.xml in this project is structured

3. Data:
Can be added via @DataProvider as in journey1 or can be added using json
Parse Json file -> Json String (using Commons-io)
Json string -> Hash Map (using Jackson)
HashMap -> Testcase (using TestNG)
