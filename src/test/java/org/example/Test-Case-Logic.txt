1. @BeforeClass:

Every new class that is made will invoke the app, so you will
be starting from the homepage with app data cleared. This is good
for tests, like functional tests, that require fresh data.

If you do multiple of '@Test' in the same class then the app will
continue from the point where the previous test ended.

By using '@BeforeMethod' you can write code that runs before every test
Example:

@BeforeMethod
public void preSetup(){
    //set screen
    Activity activity = new Activity(*package-name*, *activity-name*);
    /*
    To find these, go to the required screen in the emulator then go to
    terminal and type:
    dumpsys window displays | grep -E ‘mCurrentFocus’
    */
}

2. Running Test Cases Together

Sequentially:
